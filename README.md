<h1> Design Documentation <h1>
<h2> Process of implementation:<h2>
<h3> Drawing the canvas:<h3> 
	``` javascript 
	"function canvasDraw() {
  			ctx.fillStyle = "grey";
  			ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  			ctx.fillStyle = "#00ff00";"
	``` 
<h3> Drawing the NPC <h3> 
	``` javascript
	"function NPC() {
		ctx.fillRect( rX, rY, 30, 30);
		ctx.fill();
		ctx.fillStyle= "#FE0000";"
	```
<h2> IDE use and features: <h2>
	<h3> Notepad was used as the IDE its a simple text program with no added features. <h3>
<h2> Debugging process: <h2> 
	<h3> For debugging the IDE did not have any features so the console from the platform was used. This was Google Chrome. <h3>
<h2> Coding Standards: <h2>
	<h3> Indentation: <h3>
	``` javascript
	function start() {
			// set a radius for the circle
			const RADIUS = 20;
	``` 
	<h3> Spaces before and after Operators: <h3>
	``` javascript
	x += e.movementX; ```
	<h3>
<h2> Evaluation <h2>
	<h3> Debugging helped find and locate the errors in the code and improve the functionality of the program. <h3>
	```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look maâ€™, no spaces");
}
```
